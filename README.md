# UNI Go Client

Provides API level access for CLI tooling.

## Getting Started

There is an [example](example/client.go) of how to use this in tree.

In order to use this example you must first download a service account token from the unikorn UI (under the `Identity > Service Accounts` section), and save it in `~/.config/unikorn/token`.

## Documentation

All APIs are [documented](https://github.com/nscaledev/uni-api-docs) from the the OpenAPI source files.
