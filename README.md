# Go Client

Provides API level access for CLI tooling.

## Getting Started

There is an [example](example/client/main.go) of how to use this in tree.

In order to use this example you must first download a service account token from the UI.

There is also a token rotation [example](example/tokenrotator/main.go), as these are relatively short lived and will need to be refreshed periodically.

## Documentation

All APIs are [documented](https://github.com/nscaledev/uni-api-docs) from the the OpenAPI source files.
